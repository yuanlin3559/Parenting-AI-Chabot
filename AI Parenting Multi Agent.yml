            \ \n\n* **Pre-linguistic Stage (Birth to 12 Months):** During this stage,\
            \ infants begin to develop the foundations of language, including vocalizations,\
            \ babbling, and understanding simple words.\n* **One-Word Stage (12-18\
            \ Months):** Children start to use single words to express their needs\
            \ and desires.\n* **Two-Word Stage (18-24 Months):** Children begin to\
            \ combine two words into simple phrases, such as \"want milk\" or \"more\
            \ juice.\"\n* **Telegraphic Speech (2-3 Years):** Children use short,\
            \ grammatically incomplete sentences, focusing on key words.\n* **Early\
            \ Multiword Stage (3-5 Years):** Children's language becomes more complex,\
            \ with longer sentences and more sophisticated grammar.\n* **Later Multiword\
            \ Stage (5+ Years):** Children continue to refine their language skills,\
            \ developing fluency, vocabulary, and understanding of complex grammatical\
            \ structures.\n</example>\n\n<example>\n**User Input Query:** How can\
